## Activities

- Review software documentation
- Design and document test scenarios
- Design and document test plans
- Design or develop automated testing tools.
- Document and report software defects using a bug tracking system
- Provide feedback and recommendations to developers on software usability and functionality.
- Create or maintain databases of known test defects.

## Test scenario design

- The test case **MUST** follow a name convetion
- The test case **MUST** have an unique ID
- The test case **MUST** have a short descrition
- The test case **MUST** have a short algorithm with easy to follow steps
- The test case **MUST** be atomic and test only single features
- The test case **SHOULD** be reusable 
- The test case **SHOULD** return PASSED, FAILED or SKIPPED
- The test case **SHOULD** describe all prerequirements
